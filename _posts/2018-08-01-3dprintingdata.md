title: 3D printing data

My summer project at C4K was to create a visual 3D form of a dataset. I looked through different data sets and found one on the average prices of avocados
in different regions over a number of years. I uploaded that data into R and looked at it, played with it, and tried to understand it. 
I looked online to try and find if there were any packages or functions I could use to make the process of creating an STL file easier.
I used the r2stl package to create my 3D model. It took a lot of messing around in R, using various dataframes, and reading the R for Datascience
book.  
When I had my final 3D model of the data, I went to print it. When I printed in the first time it kind of folded over on itself and made 
it look like a disfigured square. The second time I printed it I printed it on it's side and it worked out much butter.
